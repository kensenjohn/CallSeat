We are using sdl4j along with log4j.

Therefore it will be using the log4j config style.

Make changes in following file.
/usr/local/apache-tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties

Add in Constants.java
	public static String SCHEDULER_LOGS = "SchedulerLogging";
	

	use the value above in the log4j.properties
	log4j.category.SchedulerLogging=DEBUG,SchedulerLog
		this will also hold the level of Logging,
			ex: DEBUG, INFO, etc
		This will also create and alias which will be used by other parameters.
			ex: SchedulerLog
			
	Then create rest of the parameters using the alias "SchedulerLog"
