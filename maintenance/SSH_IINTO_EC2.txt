SSH into AWS

1) Make sure your EC2 isntance has the appropriate Security Group
2) The Seucrity Group should have SSH with the port range set to your IP address or to 0.0.0.0/0 (The whole internet)
3) Make sure you have the key pair(.pem) file that you assigned to this instance during setup.
4) Go to the folder, set the permission of the .pem file to "read"
	chmod 400 <key_pair_pemfile>

5) From the EC2 Dashboard get the Public DNS name for the isntance. SElect the instance, and go to the details about it. One of the parameter is Public DNS.
6) Use Putty, or terminal to SSH using the following command

     ssh -i <key_pair_pemfile> root@<public_dns_name>

	Username(root) can be different for different instances.
	I used a "bitnami" AMI for my instnace. The username was "bitnami"
