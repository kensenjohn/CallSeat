We use the SCP command to copy files and directories into the EC2 image, from the local folder.

scp - stand for secure copy.

Copy a File

scp <source_file> <remote_machine_username>@<remote_machine_host_name>:<desticantion_directory>

ex:
scp index.html root@mylocalhost.com:/home/kjohn/

Executing this will prompt you for the remote host password.
Enter password and hit enter.
If password is correct, it will show the file being copied. Number of bytes copied and the speed at which it is being trasfered.

Recursively copy a directory
Use the -r option

scp -r <source_directory> <remote_machine_username>@<remote_machine_host_name>:<desticantion_directory>

ex:
scp -r /home/localwebapp/* root@mylocalhost.com:/home/kjohn/

Similary will ask the password. After validating password will show the list of files it is being copied.
It will maintain the directory structure at the destination.

For EC2:
We are going to use the SSH key .pem file along with the above two options.
to use the .pem file for authentication, we use the -i option similar to SSH.

The username and domain of the amazon ec2 instance will vary.

copy 1 file to EC2
scp -i <location_of_pemfile> <source_file> <remote_machine_username>@<remote_machine_host_name>:<desticantion_directory>
scp -i /usr/localdescktop/password.pem index.html root@my_amazon_ec2.com:/home/kjohn/

copy recursive directory
scp -i <location_of_pemfile> -r <source_directory> <remote_machine_username>@<remote_machine_host_name>:<desticantion_directory>
scp -i /usr/localdescktop/password.pem -r /home/localwebapp/* root@my_amazon_ec2.com:/home/kjohn/
