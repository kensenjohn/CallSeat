Setting up the Amazon EC2 instance.
1) Go to the amazon AWS website
2) Login - create the intial developer key etc etc. will take a few days

Create Instance
	- In the AWS Management Consol - EC2 DashBoard
	- Click Laucnh
	- Search for the type of instance you want. FreeBSD
	- Hit Select.
	- Select the instance type you want to run (micro/small/medium)
	- Select the region you want it to be in.
	- Hit Next/Continue
	- As of now leave Kernel and Ram empty
	- Select "Prevention against accidental termination. ". This will prevent us from hitting "terminate", which will destroy the instnace.
	- Hit Continue
	- Add a Tag to identify the instance
	- Hit Continue
	- This is where you setup a Key Pair. This will be downloaded to your machine. 
		The keypair is the security stuff used to ssh into the EC2 instance from your local machine.
	- If you are creating a key pair.
		Enter a Name and then
		Click to create your key pair:*
			This will download the key pair to yor local. You can move it to where ever you want to.
			When you ssh, you will be using the key to get in.

			Ex: Go to the folder where the keypair is stored.
				in your putty or terminal type the following command

				ssh -i <key_pair_name>  <usernam_of_instance>@<domain_of_instance>

		If you have alredy created a keypair and want to reuse it.
		Select it from the "Choose from your existing Key Pairs" drop down.

	- Hit Continue
	- Now you come to Security area. This is the Firewall setting.
		This is where you tell the firewall for your instance, what request to allow.
		Who to be able to execute the requests. etc
		
			For SSH:
				> Select SSH 
						Port 22
			For Ping Capabiltiy:
				> Select Custom ICMP
						Select All (Under Type dropdown)

		How to select the Source(the IP address range)

				If you want only your desk top computer to be able to access the EC2 instance:
				- Get the IP address of your local machine
				- example : 64.132.35.12/32
					the  "/32" indicates a subnet mask.

				If you want the entire internet to access the instance. Be careful when you are set this up for SSH.
						0.0.0.0/0

				Add as many ranges as you want to limit or allow access to the EC2 Instance.


		Give this security group an appropriate name
		ex: mystance_dev_Security

		You can create multiple security groups.
		Then attach and instance to a security group that you want.
